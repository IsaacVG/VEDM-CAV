Open Source Overview

============================

VEDM-CAV 1.0 is an innovative framework for simulating machine driving in a traffic simulator, VISSIM. This expands on the existing simulation work which is largely based on human driver models. This framework describes a new tool to facilitate simulation for testing a wide range of machine driving activities. The framework provides an extensible library that represents the basic knowledge necessary to do the innovative tasks associated with machine driving. We make this knowledge accessible to students and researchers by providing/describing a GUI to facilitate learning and experimentation. The framework presented provides a capability to simulate cooperative/collaborative maneuvers by individual vehicles in established traffic flow not before found in the native functionality of commercial simulators. The use of the package 
requires Visual Studio 2013 and VISSIM version 6.19 (both 32 bit version preferred) to run the model.

No license needed.




System Requirements


-------------------------


The VEDM-CAV 1.0 can run on most standard Window platforms with 
Pentium core processers, with at least two gigabits of RAM and at least 100 MB of drive space.
Performance of the software will be based on the computing power and available RAM in 
the system.  Larger datasets can require much larger space requirements depending on the 
amount of data being read into the software.

The VEDM-CAV 1.0 was developed using C# for VISSIM COM interface and C++ for VISSIM Driver Model API.
Currently this application only runs on Windows operating systems, due to limitations of VISSIM.
